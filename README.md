# PuppetModules
This is my repositery for puppet modules I have made at Linux Puppet course in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences.
With **start.sh**, you will get installed Git and Puppet. After that it clones this repository and applies apply.sh.

**Apply.sh** applies modules:
* react-native
* atom
* android-studio

Atom and Android-studio installation takes time up to 5 minutes. Open android studio with:

    cd /opt/android-studio/bin
    ./studio.sh
